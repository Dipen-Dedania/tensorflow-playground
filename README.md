# tensorflow-tutorials

If you are passionate about Machine learning and you don't have PHD in maths and 
you are struggling with Tensorflow tutorials, I believe this sample code might help you out.
I have created this repo while learning Tensorflow from different sources, hoping that, this might be useful to someone.


## Packages

pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

OR

pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

If you choose to go with GPU version, you might face issue with the driver compatibility. I have tried with NVIDIA graphic card (GTX 1060). I have to install CUDA & CUDNN. You can download and install it from official sites.


## Lib Packages

pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install prettytensor
