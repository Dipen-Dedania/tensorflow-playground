# tensorflow-tutorials

If you are passionate about Machine learning and you don't have PHD in maths and you are struggling with Tensorflow tutorials, I believe this sample code might help you out. I have created this repo while learning Tensorflow from different sources, hoping that, this might be useful to someone.


## Packages

```
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

OR

pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```
If you choose to go with GPU version, you might face issue with the driver compatibility. I have tried with NVIDIA graphic card (GTX 1060). I have to install CUDA & CUDNN. You can download and install it from official sites.


## Lib Packages

```
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install prettytensor
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
```


# OpenCV

Installation with windows
```
pip install opencv-python
```

So, you are still with me and trying to have fun with opencv. Good :+1 We are able to detect face with face_detection.py. Now you will probably wonder to test it with your smart-phone. Answer is YES. You can do it. Just download an app IP WEBCAM (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam). Once you run it, you will get a video streaming URL. Just paste it to opencv_android_mobile.py, connect your phone with USB or wifi router and you are good to go.
